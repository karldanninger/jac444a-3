My task is to Save Plotted Locations, & display them in a combobox

March 30 ____________________

Implemented most of the rudimentary logic to display past
locations.  Combobox is displayed.

BUG: Combobox will not update after click.  Program needs to be
restarted to see the changes.  

Potential Fixes:
 >> Using defaultComboBoxModel might be able to update dynamically
 
Implemented method to create/append lines of plotted locations to
a file stored on local machine. Using BufferedReader/BufferedWriter
