# JAC444: Assignment 2 

Proposal for ASSIGNMENT2 :
Feature Set:

1. Be able to plot a location based on the map GUI & give the coordinates relative to HOW/WHERE you initially rendered the map.
  Bonus: Save location???
  
2. Introduce a list of clicked locations Bunus: RE-render the map to the specific location chosen.
  - maybe include a textfile with all locations saved that the application can use to plot recent locations

If time permits:

3. Render multiple locations in one instance to flip between (from the locations saved from features 1 & 2)
